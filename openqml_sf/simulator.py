Base simulator class
====================

**Module name:** :mod:`openqml_sf.simulator`

.. currentmodule:: openqml_sf.simulator

A base class for constructing Strawberry Fields devices for OpenQML.
This class provides all the boilerplate for supporting OpenQML;
inheriting devices simply need to provide their engine run command
in :meth:`~.StrawberryFieldsSimulator.pre_expval`, as well as defining their ``_operation_map``
and ``_expectation_map``, mapping OpenQML operations to their
Strawberry Fields counterparts.
