The PennyLane-SF plugin integrates the StrawberryFields photonic quantum computing framework with PennyLane's
quantum machine learning capabilities.

`PennyLane <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io>`__ is a machine learning library for optimization and
automatic differentiation of hybrid quantum-classical computations.

`Strawberry Fields <https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io>`__ is a full-stack Python library
for designing, simulating, and optimizing photonic quantum circuits.

The plugin documentation can be found here: `PennyLane-Strawberry Fields <https://pennylane-sf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.


Features
========

* Provides two devices to be used with PennyLane: ``strawberryfields.fock`` and ``strawberryfields.gaussian``. These provide access to the Strawberry Fields Fock and Gaussian backends respectively.

* Supports all core PennyLane operations and observables across the two devices.

* Combine Strawberry Fields optimized simulator suite with PennyLane's automatic differentiation and optimization.

Installation
============

Installation of PennyLane-SF, as well as all required Python packages, can be installed via ``pip``:
::

   	$ python -m pip install pennylane-sf


Make sure you are using the Python 3 version of pip.

Alternatively, you can install PennyLane-SF from the source code by navigating to the top directory and running
::

	$ python setup.py install

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

PennyLane-SF requires the following libraries be installed:

* `Python <http://python.org/>`__ >=3.6

as well as the following Python packages:

* `PennyLane <http://pennylane.readthedocs.io/>`__ >=0.7
* `StrawberryFields <https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io/>`__ >=0.11.2


If you currently do not have Python 3 installed,
we recommend `Anaconda for Python 3 <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`__, a distributed
version of Python packaged for scientific computation.

Software tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure that PennyLane-SF is working correctly after installation, the test suite can be
run by navigating to the source code folder and running
::

	$ make test


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the HTML documentation, go to the top-level directory and run
::

    $ make docs

The documentation can then be found in the ``doc/_build/html/`` directory.
