PennyLane Strawberry Fields Plugin
##################################

:Release: |release|
:Date: |today|


This PennyLane plugin allows the Strawberry Fields simulators to be used as PennyLane devices.

`Strawberry Fields <https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io>`_ is a full-stack Python library for designing, simulating, and optimizing continuous variable (CV) quantum optical circuits.

`PennyLane <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io>`_ is a machine learning library for optimization and automatic differentiation of hybrid quantum-classical computations.


Features
========

* Provides two devices to be used with PennyLane: ``strawberryfields.fock`` and ``strawberryfields.gaussian``. These provide access to the Strawberry Fields Fock and Gaussian backends respectively.


* Supports all core PennyLane operations and observables across the two devices.


* Combine Strawberry Fields' advanced quantum simulator suite with PennyLane's automatic differentiation and optimization.


To get started with the PennyLane Strawberry Fields plugin, follow the :ref:`installation steps <installation>`, then see the :ref:`usage <usage>` page.
